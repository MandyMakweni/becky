            <p>My name is Bekezela meaning patience but my friends call me Beke.<br> I love showing off my imagination and ideas through building creative websites.<br>The programming languages i use to build these websites are HTML,CSS,JS and JQuery.What i like about coding or programming no one can govern you on what to produce or what to do thats one of the reasons why i decided to take this course so that i get paid for doing what i love.During my leisure time i like experimenting with food for example cooking Chicken Akni. I love to be out doors camping,hiking because i believe and feels it helps me relax,get away from the hectic fast pace life in the CBD.  </p>
